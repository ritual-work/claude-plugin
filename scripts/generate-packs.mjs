/**
 * generate-packs.mjs — DETERMINISTIC generator for the development-function
 * persona packs, from the canonical snapshot (canonical/plugin-snapshot.json,
 * synced from Ritual's monorepo work-graph). NO LLM.
 *
 * For each dev persona that LEADS ≥1 job, emits a pack:
 *   plugins/<persona>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
 *   plugins/<persona>/commands/<command-name>.md   (one per LEAD job)
 *   plugins/<persona>/skills/<persona>-guide/SKILL.md   (thin discoverability)
 * and updates .claude-plugin/marketplace.json + canonical/jtbd-allowlist.json.
 *
 * Commands are job-native (`/<persona>:<command-name>`), user-invoked — zero
 * model arbitration. The command body embeds the PUBLIC Ritual orchestration
 * seeded with the job's jtbd_id + persona (an L1 projection — it points at the
 * MCP capability, never restates Ritual's internal flow), and degrades to
 * build-discipline when Ritual isn't connected.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/generate-packs.mjs [--check]
 *   --check : exit 1 if any committed pack file is stale (CI guard).

# ${label}: ${titleCase(cmd.commandName)}

${cmd.summary} A **standalone check** — it runs a local recipe; **no Ritual
discovery engine needed**.

What to review: $ARGUMENTS

**Apply the build-discipline posture** — surface assumptions, define what "good"
means here, keep it surgical, and verify against the checklist.

## Run it
1. Read the request through the **${label}** lens (job: \`${cmd.jtbdId}\`).
2. Surface assumptions + the success criteria for this review.
3. Work the checklist against the code/surface under review:
${checklist}
4. Verify each item — confirmed present, or raised as an explicit gap (note the file/line).
   **Done when:** ${cmd.doneCriteria}
5. **Escalate to Ritual discovery** (\`ritual build\`, or this pack's discovery
   commands) ONLY if the task turns out ambiguous, cross-functional, or needs
   constraints that live outside the code — say so rather than guessing.

No Ritual connection is required for this check.

# ${label}: ${titleCase(cmd.commandName)}

Scope **${titleCase(cmd.jtbdId)}** through the ${label} lens — a Ritual discovery
command that produces a **${cmd.deliverableTemplate}** (a decision-ready brief,
not code), then folds that brief into plan mode before any implementation. When
Ritual is connected this is the same flow as \`ritual build\`, seeded for this job.

The user's request: $ARGUMENTS

**Apply the build-discipline posture throughout** — surface assumptions, define
success criteria, keep changes surgical, and verify the constraints survived.
(\`build-discipline\` is this pack's dependency + offline fallback; its posture is
woven into the steps below, so you don't rely on it firing ambiently.)

## 1 · Frame — before Ritual
- Read the request through the **${label}** lens and this job (**${cmd.jtbdId}**).
- Surface assumptions, missing inputs, constraints, and anti-goals — state them
  explicitly; never silently guess a load-bearing ambiguity.
- Establish the success criteria for the deliverable.

## 2 · Discover — run Ritual (MCP is the runtime)
Discovery runs on the **Ritual MCP**. Check, in order:
1. **Ritual MCP available** (\`mcp__ritual__*\` tools present)? → **use it.** Create
   an exploration for the request seeded with **jtbd \`${cmd.jtbdId}\`** under the
   **${persona}** lens, focused on the ${label} sections below; walk discovery →
   recommendations → build brief (poll
   \`get_exploration_status.recommendationsStatus\` until \`ready\`), review the
   recommendations, and fold the returned brief into plan mode. Same experience
   as \`ritual build\` today.
2. **Only the \`ritual\` CLI is present** (MCP not wired yet)? → the CLI is the
   **setup path**: \`ritual init\` authenticates + connects the MCP, then re-run
   this command. The CLI is how you install/connect/repair Ritual — not a runtime
   dependency.
3. **Neither** → Ritual isn't connected this session. Say so plainly and offer the
   one-step setup (don't imply the CLI is always required — a user may already
   have the MCP wired via a custom connector / Claude Code MCP config, in which
   case step 1 applies):
   \`\`\`
   ritual init   # authenticate, connect the Ritual MCP, install recommended plugins
   \`\`\`
   While not connected, offer to either (a) continue with a local checklist only,
   or (b) stop here until Ritual is connected. Don't proceed as if the missing
   context were resolved.

## 3 · Verify — after Ritual
- Confirm the resulting brief/output preserves the original constraints + success
  criteria.
- Explicitly list any unresolved assumptions, questions, or risks. Don't proceed
  as if uncertain points are resolved.

## What you contribute (${label} sections)
${sections}

The full ${cmd.deliverableTemplate} composes ${cmd.composedSectionCount} sections
across every contributing lens; the above are the ${label}'s own. Speak in the
practitioner's language — the work and its outcome, never routing internals.

# ${label} — pack guide

When a task looks like ${label} work, the right entry is a **job-native command**
(user-invoked, no guessing). Suggest the closest match:

${cmdList}

Each command scopes its job into a decision-ready Ritual brief (not code) and
degrades cleanly when Ritual isn't connected. If none fit, defer to
**build-discipline** for generic tiering.
